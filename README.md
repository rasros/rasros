## Rasmus Ros

PhD in Computer Science (Lund University), currently Tech Lead at [Theca](https://theca.com). I work on ML systems, constraint optimization, and data-driven software infrastructure.

### Repos

- **[KPermute](https://github.com/Eignex/kpermute)** Kotlin library for shuffling lists too big for memory or for ID obfuscation. Using bijective integer permutations with fast cycle-walking hash mixing.
- **[KEncode](https://github.com/Eignex/kpermute)** Compact, ASCII-safe encodings and ultra-small binary serialization for Kotlin, ideal for URLs, headers, file names, and other size-limited channels.
- **[COMBO](https://github.com/Eignex/combo)** (Constraint-Oriented Multi-Variate Bandit Optimization): a toolkit for online optimization of LLM prompts or software parameters using live data. This is under reconstruction.
- **[lx](https://github.com/rasros/lx)** Converts files into simple Markdown-fenced blocks for easy use in LLM chats.
- **[Base system](https://github.com/lunduniversity/largesofteng)** Open education labs for a course on system design and modern software practices at scale.
