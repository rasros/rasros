## Rasmus Ros

PhD in Computer Science (Lund University), currently Tech Lead at [Theca.com](https://theca.com). I work on ML systems, constraint optimization, and data-driven software infrastructure.

### Repos

- **[KPermute](https://github.com/Eignex/kpermute)** Kotlin library for shuffling lists too big for memory or for ID obfuscation. Using bijective integer permutations with fast cycle-walking hash mixing. 
- **[COMBO](https://github.com/Eignex/combo)** (Constraint-Oriented Multi-Variate Bandit Optimization): a toolkit for online optimization of LLM prompts or software parameters using live data. It supports formal constraints like token budgets and user tiers making it suitable for handling scalibility challenges in agentic AI. The system is built around Bayesian optimization and contextual bandits, deployable in Kubernetes.
- **[Base system](https://github.com/lunduniversity/largesofteng)** Open education labs at Lund University. The course focuses on system design and modern software practices at scale through web development.
